# Problem

Building a prototype toolchain for a general purpose grouping mechanism (a la function block) for [Brick](http://brickschema.org).

**Note:** It is not supposed to be the final solution.

# Repository Layout

* [src](src) Source code
* [src/group.py](src/group.py) Main module
* [src/Makefile](src/Makefile) Build all models and run demo (assumes that this is checked out side-by-side with the brick repository)
* [src/demo](src/demo) demonstration of module
* [doc](doc) Documentation
* [doc/introduction.md](doc/introduction.md) Introduction to the problem
* [doc/demo.md](doc/demo.md) Demonstation of prototype (start here unless you know better)
